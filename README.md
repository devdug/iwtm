# IWTM => I Want That Means...
## A better way to get visibility and measure progress for Software and other projects.
###### Inspired by #NOESTIMATES
### Why another software development methodology?
After a particularly brutal project I decided I never wanted to ever experience anything like that again.

I vowed to learn from that project and the many others I have been involved with and create something to help others to not fall into the trap of time driven projects. And hopefully persuade them to move away from time metrics to artifact value metrics.

And as importantly, educate stake holders so they are not unknowingly making bad decisions. This will only happen if they have visibility into progress and understand what value has been produced to date. Enough visibility that they can confidently determine go or no-go as the project moves forward.

This project is not about methodology as much as it is about tactics and tools to gather pertinent timely data and transform that into useful and meaningful visibility for all concerned.

## Goals
- Eat my own dog-food by using the IWTM to develop IWTM.
- Develop tools that will unobtrusively gather metrics as project assets are created.
- Have consistent patterns for the decomposition of what a `want` really `means`.
- Consistent feedback to qualify and quantify lower level `bottom up` effects on higher level `wants`.  

 Things always change as knowledge is gained throughout the chain of progression across: `concepts -> features -> artifacts -> implementations -> integrations -> merges -> bugs`
