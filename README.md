# IWTM => I Want That Means...
## A better way to get visibility and measure progress for Software and other projects.
###### Inspired by #NOESTIMATES
### Why another software development methodology?
After a particularly brutal project I decided I never wanted to ever experience anything like that again.

I vowed to learn from that project and the many others I have been involved with and create something to help others to not fall into the trap of time driven projects.

And as importantly, educate stake holders so they are not unknowingly making bad decisions.

This project is not about methodology as much as it is about tactics to gather pertinent timely data and transform that into useful and meaningful visibility for all concerned.
